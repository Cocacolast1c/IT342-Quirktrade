Developers Profile:

I am Gwyn Sapio, a 3rd year BSIT student at CIT-U.
I'm not really into coding but since I'm taking this program, I'm trying my hardest to learn.
I currently enjoy playing "Don't Starve" and I'm still stuck at night 5! Though I love spending time with my friends and love ones, I favor savoring my hours in solitude much more. Going to places and trying all cuisines is my dream. <>

Course & Year: BSIT-3

I am a 3rd Year student of CIT-U on the 2nd Semester for the School Year of 2024-2025. I like to browse the internet be it for reading books or watching youtube videos. My hobies are also computer related as I like to game with my friends be it whatever they want to play as it is more fun to play with others. Another thing about me is that I also am an aspiring software programer as can be seen here where I am practicing coding projects. Lastly currently I am still looking for ideas for my project in IT365 for a website with a mobile aplication.
